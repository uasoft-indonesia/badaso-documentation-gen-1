Analytics is useful for getting site visitor information such as the number of visitors to a page, the average length of time visitors have accessed the site, etc. To use analytics on badaso, you must create [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web) account first. After that, get the View ID and Tracking ID from your analytics.

Insert the View ID and Tracking ID from your analytics to .env variable `ANALYTICS_VIEW_ID` and `MIX_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID`.

To retrieve the site visitor information, you must create a service account for your analytics and download the service-account.json file. After that, you can store it in storage directory like below.

```
ðŸ“¦ Your Project
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ storage
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ app
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ analytics
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ service-account-crendetial.js   /** Store the .json file here. **/
```

:::important
You can adjust the service account credential store directory in `analytics.php` config file.

Analytics will only detect visitor from accessing generated CRUD only.
