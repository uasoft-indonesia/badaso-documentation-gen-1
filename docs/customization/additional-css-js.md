## CSS

Badaso uses SCSS for styling. You can add custom css in the `scss` directory as in the shown below. You can directly create css in `custom.scss` or create new scss file and import it in `custom.scss`. Badaso only read `custom.scss`

```
ðŸ“¦ Your Project
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ resources
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ js
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ badaso
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ scss
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ custom.scss
```

## JS

To add custom JS such as vanilla JS or other libraries, you can do it like installing a regular javascript library on laravel.
- To add a library, install the library as usual in the laravel project root.
- For the addition of other JS scripts, it can be installed on all JS badaso as needed.
