## CSS

You can add custom css in the `assets` directory as in the shown below. Each SCSS file that is created, must register or import to the style.scss file

```
|-- your project
    |-- resources
        |-- js
            |-- badaso
                |-- assets
                    |-- scss
```

## JS

To add custom JS such as vanilla JS or other libraries, you can do it like installing a regular javascript library on laravel.
- To add a library, install the library as usual in the laravel project root.
- For the addition of other JS scripts, it can be installed on all JS badaso as needed.
